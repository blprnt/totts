          This is the year it happens. 
        </p>

        <p class="intro">Regardless of whether you are a journalist or a designer, scientist or sales rep, you will be facing an empty text box. You will fill it with a string of words. And from that prompt will spring into being a page of text, an image, a video, or a piece of music. All these things, and a thousand like them, will come to pass in the year 2023. Myriads of small generative miracles will occur every day, as we all summon into being statistical representations of the online past. Neural network architectures trained on vast corpuses of text and images, scraped indiscriminately from the internet, will make confident predictions to answer any question or request you may have. And many of those responses will be very close to brilliant, often nearly right. But sometimes, often without anyone noticing or caring very much, the answers will be wrong.</p>

          One afternoon in the early autumn of 1984, a group of scientists at
          IBM’s research labs in Yorktown Heights, showed reporters a computer
          that had learned how to listen. The machine, Fred Jelinek explained to
          those who had gathered, could recognize almost anything a person said,
          and then display what had been spoken on its screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So far the machine has worked for everyone who has tried it," Jelinek
          told reporters. "There have been no failures at all."
        </p>
      </div>
        <p>
          No failures, but a couple of important caveats. First, Jeline
          explained, the computer needed to learn the speaker’s voice, which it
          did by listening to a series of one hundred sentences. The speaker
          needed to train the computer by speaking a particular set of words in
          a specific order. Second, the person talking to the computer needed to
          speak slowly, with a short pause between words.
